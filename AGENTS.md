## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as local markdown files under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default label vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context repo — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Workflow rules

### Committing

After every successfully implemented feature, create a single git commit that captures all related changes. Do not leave implemented features uncommitted. One feature = one commit.
